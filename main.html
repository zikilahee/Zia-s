    <p>To The Sweetest Girl I Know, My Via!😘</p>
    <p>
      Its finally my baby's birthday!! I've anticipated it as much as you if not more😂😭. The reason for my
      joy isn't just that you're plus one or you're finally 18. It is because we get to finally celebrate the day
      that God brought my best friend into the world!! That August when we started talking like immediately we started
      talking i felt a spark i thought i will never feel in my life and right till this moment i still feel it. Its not just
      your beauty that attracted me, its your heart! The way you think, the way you care, the way you love. Its just different
      it is something i've never seen before. Thank you so much Via for being there for me always when i need, thank you for always
      giving me an extra boost when i need it, thank you for always believing in me and most importantly thank you for being
      MINE!!!! I love you so much!❤️❤️😘

    </p>
    <p>
      On your birthday, I just want you to know how deeply loved you are. I'm really grateful to God for making you
      see another year. Not just another year, the year you turn legal!! I pray that this new year will give you nothing but
      blessings, favour, peace and love. Happy 18th my baby!❤️
    </p>

      Forever yours,
