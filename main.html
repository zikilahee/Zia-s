    <p>To The Sweetest Girl I Know, My Via!😘</p>
    <p>
      Its finally my baby's birthday!! I've anticipated it as much as you if not more😂😭. The reason for my
      joy isn't just that you're plus one or you're finally 18. It is because we get to finally celebrate the day
      that God brought my best friend into the world!! That August when we started talking like immediately we started
      talking i felt a spark i thought i will never feel in my life and right till this moment i still feel it. Its not just
      
    </p>
    <p>
      On your birthday, I just want you to know how deeply loved you are —  
      not just today, but every single day.  
      You deserve all the happiness in the world, my beautiful soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forever yours,  
      <br><strong>[Your Name]</strong>
